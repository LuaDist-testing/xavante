Xavante 2.0
http://keplerproject.org/xavante/

Xavante is a Lua HTTP 1.1 Web server that uses a modular architecture based on URI mapped handlers.
Xavante currently offers a file handler, a redirect handler and a WSAPI handler.
Those are used for general files, URI remapping and WSAPI applications respectively.

Xavante is free software and uses the same license as Lua.

Xavante can be downloaded from its LuaForge page:
http://luaforge.net/projects/xavante/

You can also install Xavante using LuaRocks:
luarocks install xavante

Dependencies

Xavante dependencies can be separated by the used handlers:

Xavante Core
        * Lua 5.1.x
        * Copas 1.1.3
        * LuaSocket 2.0.2

File Handler (optional)
        * LuaFileSystem 1.4.1

The portability of Xavante is determined by its binary components
(LuaSocket and LuaFileSystem) and Lua itself.
The other components are written in Lua and are as portable as Lua itself.

Xavante 2.0 [23/May/2008] changes:
        * New WSAPI based cgiluahandler
        * Fixed a bug on SAPI.redirect that was not setting the statusline correctly
        * First version using LuaRocks
